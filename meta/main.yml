  # With the release of version 2.10, Ansible finally correctly
  # identifies Kali Linux as being the Kali distribution of the Debian
  # OS family.  This simplifies a lot of things for roles that support
  # Kali Linux, so it makes sense to force the installation of Ansible
  # 2.10 or newer.
  min_ansible_version: 2.10
  platforms:
    - name: Debian
      versions:
        - buster
        # Kali linux isn't an option here, but it is based on
        # Debian Testing:
        # https://www.kali.org/docs/policy/kali-linux-relationship-with-debian
        #
        # Unfortunately, the Debian Bullseye deb packages available at
        # https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell do not install on a
        # recent Debian Bullseye instance due to broken dependencies.
        # Kali Linux provides its own package, so it still works, but
        # we cannot support Debian Bullseye right now.
